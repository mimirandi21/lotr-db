During the filming of the ""Mount Caradhras"" scene in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), he chose to walk to the top for 2 hours every day. While his fellow cast members were ferried in by helicopter, they could often see him hiking in costume to the shooting site. After having flown back to England when his shoot was over, Peter Jackson conceived of an elaborate flashback scene for which Bean was again required to fly to New Zealand. Unfortunately, the scene was later omitted from the movie, although it was included in the extended DVD edition."	"Of his many death scenes, his favorite is Boromir's in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), commenting that ""you couldn't ask for a more heroic death""."	"Sean Bean has become a source of popular Facebook/Internet memes of his character Boromir in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" films. The memes always begin with the line ""One simply does not..."" followed by a humorous quote or reference to something in the news or pop culture. This is based on his line ""One does not simply walk into Mordor.""."	[Talking about his character Boromir] He's a fallen hero, a very gentle man under that exterior. He's lived in an environment always ravaged by war and had to be realistic. He wants to use the ring against the enemy instead of destroying it. He doesn't understand the complexities this piece of metal can have on human beings.	There's a wealth of literature out there which, hopefully, will be, you know, exploded in the future, and I personally find it very rewarding to be involved with classic storytelling, and sort of legendary characters.	I've played a lot of baddies, they were great but they weren't very fulfilling - and I always died.

Astin was able to borrow a cutting-edge digital camera from Lucasfilm representatives (who had been demonstrating the camera for Jackson) for a day to make the short. The film was included as a bonus on the DVD release of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)."	"On 4 December 2001, Sean had his image as Samwise Gamgee immortalized on a 90-cent New Zealand postage stamp that he shares with ""Lord of the Rings"" co-star Elijah Wood (Frodo Baggins). However, Sean's last name is spelled incorrectly on the presentation pack of the stamps (Austin instead of Astin)."	"Had to gain 35 to 40 pounds for his role of Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."	[refuting the remarks of cast and crew that he IS Samwise Gamgee] But I'm not really Sam . . . nobody could be that good, that noble. He's just better than the rest of us. I'm a lot more Hollywood than Sam would ever be.	"I'd never heard of the ""Lord of the Rings"", actually. So I went to the bookstore and there it was, three shelves of books about Tolkien and Middle-earth, and I was like, ""Holy cow, what else am I missing out on?"""	"I spent the film doing lots of things, but the crying is what lived. He [Peter Jackson] tricks you into thinking you're going to get to do all these brave, heroic things most of the time, and you have to cry once in a while . . . and then he cuts out the heroic moments and you're left thinking, ""I look like a big baby""."

In an interview she gave to Fox Television Network, she admitted blushingly that she had accepted the role of Galadriel, the Elf Queen, in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because she always wanted to appear in a movie wearing pointed ears.	In 2009, she was among four Oscar-winning Australian actors to be immortalized onto postage stamps in their home country. Each of the actors has two stamps, showing them both in and out of character.	If you know you are going to fail, then fail gloriously!	I had never done anything with blue screen before, or prosthetics, or anything like that. Lord of the Rings was like stepping into a videogame for me. It was another world completely. But, to be honest, I basically did it so that I could have the ears. I thought they would really work with my bare head.	Of course one worries about getting older--we're all fearful of death, let's not kid ourselves. I'm simply not panicking as my laugh lines grow deeper. Who wants a face with no history, no sense of humor?
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089217	Orlando Bloom	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MDUyMjY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkwMjk2Mw@@._V1_SY100_CR24,0,100,100_AL_.jpg	1977		actor	During the filming for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), he fell off his horse and broke one of his ribs.	"On Orlando Bloom's last day of filming, after he had completed his scenes, Peter Jackson recorded a video of Bloom ""covering"" the viral ""They're Taking The Hobbits To Isengard"" song on his phone."	He made archery a very popular sport in the United Kingdom. Many youngsters saw him with a bow in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and decided to join archery schools.	Legolas doesn't speak a lot - he prefers to let his actions speak for him. Legolas' moves are smooth and elegant, like a cat. You know how cats can jump and land steadily on their paws? That's what I'm trying to do. There's a strength in that, but it's very balletic. It's also bloody hard to do without falling over!	"Vig used to call me ""elf boy"", and I'd call him ""filthy human"". As an Elf, I never got a scratch on me, never got dirty. And Vig would come out with blood and sweat all over him. And he'd say to me, ""Oh, go manicure your nails.""."	For a young actor like me to have the opportunity to work with the genre of actors and directors on The Lord of the Rings is unbelievable. There was no, should I should I not. It was like, where do I sign up! It was just bonkers. It was like here, have a life.

""We started writing when we were stuck up Treebeard during the second movie [The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)],"" Boyd told a reporter for the Sunday Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)"	When the dragon firework goes off at the party in The Fellowship of the Ring, the shriek heard is Billy Boyd actually screaming, as he was unaware at the time that the firework was really going to explode on-set (he thought that it would be in a separate shot). It was not scripted, but the take ended up in the final cut.	When he was first cast in The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson asked him to tone down his Scottish accent, but found that the funny parts just weren't as funny without it, so Boyd was allowed to use his regular Scottish accent. Jackson and the writers then consulted The Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins's mother was a Took, and one of their ancestors had, according to the book, invented the game of golf. Since golf is of Scottish origin, they reasoned that Tolkien must have, therefore, intended for the Tooks to be Scottish.	To play one of the main characters in it, it's not the kind of thing you don't do. Oh, I'd rather not play Pippin in Lord of the Rings..., In fact, what else would you rather do, you know? I can't actually think of another job that I'd rather do.	"[On cast camraderie during shooting ""The Lord of the Rings""] There was a lot of pranking, but that was more Dom (Dominic Monaghan) and Viggo (Viggo Mortensen). With Viggo, they were normally quite violent, aggressive ones. You would see Sean Bean walking across to his caravan, and then see this figure of Viggo running across the plains and rugby tackling him. Dom and Viggo were attacking each other's trailers for quite a while, redecorating inside and out with whatever they got their hands on. It was a very happy set, a very constructive set."	"[On being asked if he could relate to his character, Pippin] ""Strangely enough, the first time I tried to read the book I was on holiday in Florida. I dropped it in the pool my first day there. If that's not a Pippin thing to do, I don't know what is."""

He shares two roles with two other Bilbos. He and Orson Bean have both played Frodo Baggins, while he and Martin Freeman have both played King Richard III.	"When he played Frodo in the BBC radio dramatization of ""The Lord of the Rings"", he was 50 years old, the same age Frodo is when he begins his quest to destroy the One Ring."	[On his Hobbit feet in the Lord of the Rings films] These things are like boats with toes.	"I'm completely amazed by the reaction that the films have had. I get a lot of fan mail addressed to Bilbo and sometimes Sir Bilbo. It's hardly ever addressed to Ian Holm."""	"I've always been a minimalist. It was Bogart [Humphrey Bogart] who once said, ""If you think the right thoughts, the camera will pick it up."" The most important thing in the face is the eyes, and if you can make the eyes talk, you're halfway there."

However, the scene was put back into the Extended Edition which is seen as the definitive version.	One of the most prolific actors of all time, he has acted in nearly 230 films, although he later admitted that his film work was not always chosen on quality but often on whether they could support his family. His peak years of productivity were 1955 and 1970, as Lee starred in nine films in both years.	As a veritable J.R.R. Tolkien expert and the only member of the cast who had met Tolkien himself, he often visited the Production department on the sets of the various Lord of the Rings movies to give advice and tips on the various attributes of the films.	"Whenever I take a role, I try to find an element in the character which appeals to me and then go to work. Occasionally, you have doubts about how the finished film will look after it's been edited, but that's a chance you always take. I play every part for what it's worth - for its merits, no matter how big or small. What's that old cliché? ""There are no small roles, only small actors."" It's true."	I think that - apart from the fields of science and medicine - we live in an age of decline. Look at the world. There is decline in morals, ideals, manners, respect, truthfulness: just about everything, in fact.	"Most people find my villains memorable because I try to make them as unconventional as possible. They are not overt monsters. It's easy to play a ""heavy"" straight down the middle, 100%, but it's boring. I don't think I've ever played a villain who didn't have some unusual, humanizing trait. When I look back at my men with the black hats, they've always had something else going for them, whether it be a sardonic sense of humor or a feeling of desolation. I always try to throw as many curves the audience's way as possible. That's probably why people enjoy my villainy."

He based the voice of Gollum on the sounds his cats made while coughing up furballs.  Also said he based Gollum’s desperation and cravings on the withdrawls of heroin addicts.	Andy Serkis did the voices for the three orcs arguing with each other at the Fangorn Camp scene.	"[On playing Gollum in Lord of the Rings] ""Everyone has their own interpretation of what he is, what he looks like and how he sounds. So it was up to me to just trust my own instincts."""	[About his motion capture work for Gollum and for King Kong] I thought, man, I'm going to go from a three-and-a-half foot ring junkie to a twenty-five-foot gorilla, you know, and this is the end of typecasting as we know it!	"[Stephen Colbert asks Serkis to read a few Tweets by Pres. Donald Trump in the voice of Gollum] ""The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate! Sad."" ""Despite the constant negative press, covfefe--"" Wait, wait. What's covfuffy, Precious? [Colbert replies, ""No one knows.""]"

Tolkien reading Gandalf lines from the novel. He used this as a base for creating the character, and imitated the accent used by Tolkien in the recording.	Ian McKellen broke down crying after working alone against nothing but green screen for hours and hours, especially since most of his performance had to be micromanaged to fit the performances of the dwarves (which were filmed first). Peter Jackson had to console him himself. Sylvester McCoy also commented that he was a little taken back by just how glad Ian was to see him when it came time to shoot the wizard scenes.	"Was offered $1.5 million by Sean Parker to officiate at his Tolkien-themed wedding in 2013, in costume as Gandalf, but declined, saying ""Gandalf doesn't do weddings""."	When I, as Gandalf, meet Bilbo or Frodo at home, I bump my head on the rafters. [J.R.R. Tolkien] didn't think to mention it.	"""The Lord of the Rings"" is a mythology, it is a fairy tale, it's an adventure story. It never happened. Except somewhere in our hearts."	It is very, very, very difficult for an American actor who wants a film career to be open about his sexuality. And even more difficult for a woman if she's lesbian. It's very distressing to me that that should be the case. The film industry is very old fashioned in California.

He drank three liters of water a day so he would not dehydrate.	"Dominic was allergic to the elven cloaks the Fellowship wore. Before scenes were shot, Peter Jackson used to joke around and say ""Are we ready to go? Does Dom have his cape on?"""	While filming the Lord of the Rings-trilogy, he got rid of his acrophobia (fear of heights) by joining Orlando Bloom when he went bungee jumping.	I won't miss having to stand for two hours at 4:30 a.m. and having freezing cold glue applied to my feet. I won't miss two-hour drives to work or long, long, long, days sitting in my trailer waiting... waiting... waiting. I won't miss glue in my ears. But I would do it all again tomorrow.	[On Merry and Pippin's strong friendship in LotR.] For Merry, losing Pippin is like losing his strength, the other side of his personality.	You don't really see war through the eyes of a hobbit too much in the movie, but Merry becomes a warrior. To see Merry ... covered in blood, sweat and tears, and living the terrible reality, was really traumatic.
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557	Viggo Mortensen	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc4NzYyNDk0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExMjk2Mw@@._V1_SX100_CR0,0,100,100_AL_.jpg	1958		actor	Broke a tooth while filming a fight sequence for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002); he asked the crew if they would glue it back on so he could finish the scene.	Viggo Mortensen did his own stunts. He also insisted on using only the real steel sword, instead of a significantly lighter aluminum sword, or safer rubber sword, which were manufactured for battle scenes and stunts.	During filming, most of the members of the Fellowship took up surfing in New Zealand in their spare time. Amongst them was Viggo Mortensen, who wiped out terribly one day and bruised one whole side of his face. The next day, make-up artists tried to mask the bruising and swelling, but were unsuccessful. Instead, Peter Jackson opted to film Mortensen from one side for the entire scene. In the Mines of Moria, when they find the tomb, Aragorn is only seen from one side in the whole scene.	I was on my way out of a Sunday rehearsal. When I was walking out of the gym, all sort of sweaty, half in street clothes and half in Aragorn's clothes, waving the sword around, trying to keep a mental picture of what we've just done. Just walking down the street, down to where my car was parked, on a Sunday afternoon, waving the sword around, looking like some desperate Rasputin character. Cops car comes: there's been some report...	There is no star in LOTR. The Fellowship is a union.	Seeing who you are playing with is a relief. In The Lord of the Rings we did a lot of things when there was nothing there.
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722636	John Rhys-Davies	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFlMjc1YTctMTQ1Ny00MzFiLThiZjYtMzQ0YmFhZjE3MGQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc5MDI5NjE@._V1_SY100_CR70,0,100,100_AL_.jpg	1944		actor	He spent up to 5 hours a day putting on makeup for the role of Gimli in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It was discovered early on that he was allergic to the prosthetics, so he could only put them on and work about every third day. The first week, it burned off the skin under his eyes. After filming was completed he was given the appliance used and told to do what he wanted with it. One of the makeup artists claimed they had never seen him move so fast as he threw it into a nearby fire.	While working on the Lord of the Rings films, he lost seventy pounds from all the running around the part involved. When he went back to New Zealand for re-shoots, the makeup artists had to alter his Gimli makeup to better fit his slimmed-down facial features.	Lost the end tip of his left hand middle finger to the knuckle while changing a van engine. During filming of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), he was fitted with a gel tip for the finger. Rhys-Davies and the crew played a prank on director Peter Jackson by slicing the gel tip nearly in half and inserting prop blood inside. Rhys-Davies approached Jackson to tell him he was hurt and pulled open the tip, letting the blood flow out.	[On shooting Fellowship of The Ring] One of my abiding memories is being halfway up a mountain and watching two men carrying a basket with my clothes up to me, and another two carrying my armour and axe, then a woman carrying my helmet up, and finally another with my big, heavy boots to give that dwarfish trouser-look. Then they put it all on me and the director said 'now run up that hill'.	Tolkien knew that civilization is worth fighting for. There are times when a generation is challenged and must fight to defend their civilization from annihilation.	"[On returning for The Hobbit trilogy] I've already been asked and to be honest with you, I wouldn't. I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more."" He added that this time around ""They've got a different set of problems... because you've got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them... You're trying to represent a whole race... You're trying to do for dwarves what 'The Lord of the Rings' did for hobbits."

When she returned, they had melted.	Learned swordfighting for her role as Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). But the script was changed and she never got to use her skills.	"Liv Tyler accidentally stabbed herself in the right thigh when filming the ""If you want him, come and claim him!"" sequence in The Fellowship of the Ring. The footage was featured in bloopers and outtakes of this movie."	"I was in New Zealand for a long time and preparing for fight sequences - all of these kind of elaborate things. And the more I did that stuff the further we were getting away from why they cast me and what was true of Arwen. And we all realized that. And we went back into the book and into the appendix. And... reshaped it. I think originally that, when they were looking at this character, they wanted her to be a strong character. She is a strong character, but... maybe they thought, ""Oh, well if she's a fighter she's strong."" And over time they realized that you don't have to put a sword in a woman's hand to make her seem tough. That's little actual makeup of who Arwen is, and her sheer will and strength and love for this man was strong enough."	Subtlety is my favourite thing in cinema. It lets you dream. When everything is on the nail and on show, it leaves no questions in your mind. I find that so boring.	There were times when I would get mad at him (Viggo Mortensen) because he would push me harder. There was a weekend when I got really sick and had a horrible flu, and that was my one and only day to sleep and recover and not work. We were supposed to go horseback riding together and I cancelled it because I wasn't feeling well, and Viggo gave me a really hard time about it. So I went, and it was one of the greatest days of my life. It was actually the one time, while I was riding, that I really broke through to the other side with the canter and becoming more comfortable on the horse. I had a beautiful day and am incredibly grateful to Viggo for pushing me further. He taught me so much about that, about really being willing to submit and submerge yourself into making the film and the character work.

However, in the film, Hugo's character Elrond, was at least 500 years younger than Cate Blanchett's character, Galadriel.	"Has suffered from epileptic seizures since he was age 13. Because of this, he made the decision early on not to drive and he has never had a driver's license. In a 2006 interview, Weaving noted he hasn't suffered a seizure in years, but is still reluctant to get a driver's license because ""I'm so used to not driving, I'm scared of what I'd do.""."	Hugo Weaving was recovering from the flu during the filming of the scene where Elrond talks to Gandalf at Rivendell, and as a result, he had a hoarse voice. Co-writer Philippa Boyens remarked on the DVD commentary that she felt it actually enhanced the quality of his voice. 	You're certainly pushed into selling yourself as a commodity in order to sell the product. I will engage in the selling of the film. But I will try not to engage in the selling of the image, because I find that it's easier to go on and make another film, because the next character is actually obstructed if your image is bigger than it. So the longer you keep the mask on, metaphorically and physically, the better.	"One of the first things that made me want to be an actor was listening to Prokofiev's ""Romeo and Juliet"". I was intensely moved by it. I think I was about nine - I went to see the ballet. That's what made me interested in Shakespeare."	As human beings, of course, we're all compromised and complex and contradictory and if a screenplay can express those contradictions within a character and if there's room for me to express them, that's a part I'd love to play, so much more than a character who is heroic and one-dimensional.

"Is the first member of the official ""Lord of the Rings"" fanclub."	"When Frodo is stuck in Shelob's web, as Gollum taunts him, Elijah Wood was actually suspended on a harness with bungee cords fastened around his wrists and ankles. In the commentary, he jokes that he was ""not hanging up by sheer strength of the web""."	[On concluding filming of LOTR] Frodo will look more haggard, but not as bad as Gollum. There is a massive transformation, but the journey should have a physical effect on him, which makes sense as I look a lot older than when I started filming. I was 18 then, and it's appropriate that he looks older, too. And if I've done my job right, then you should empathize with him. When it came to the end, I was very emotional. I was heaving, I couldn't breathe, and the last bits of the movie really wrecked me. They gave each actor his own farewell, when we were back there earlier this year. You'd go on to a sound stage and Peter [director Peter Jackson] would make a speech about each actor and then bring in their sword and a clapperboard. It was completely overwhelming. When it came time for me to give a speech, I was so gone I just couldn't do it. I now have the ears, the feet, the sword, the Ring, and one of the maps of Middle-Earth. The whole thing has had a massive impact on us	[After the last press junket for LOTR in New York] There's a real sense of completion now, because we can look at the entirety of the trilogy and say we've done it, our work is finished. That's a great feeling. And I think that, as it comes to a close, we look to the relationships forged in New Zealand and throughout the experience, and they will carry on. The fellowship will carry on. And that gives us great hope. Our lives will interweave forever.	My philosophy has always been to try to put myself into roles and films that are different. That intensified after 'Lord of the Rings' because it was so massive, but it's something I've always believed in -- wanting to change people's perceptions and challenge myself as an actor.

We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. What we were trying to do was to analyze what was important to Tolkien and to try to honor that. In a way, we were trying to make these films for him, not for ourselves.

It's death on film. And it's not just the effect that the character out of the book has on Frodo and Sam's journey, it's the effect that character has on the Ring. You've just been desperately trying to establish that this is the most evil thing ever created, it's tearing apart the mind of your main character, it's reduced this other character to this miserable creature Gollum, and now you come along someone who says, 'I would not touch this thing if it lay on the highway.'

And the fans are very passionate about it, and you don't want to burst that bubble; you don't want to break that illusion. You want to get it right. You want it to feel familiar, but also surprising.

He started writing The Lord of the Rings with no idea where the story would eventually go.

Bernard Hill believed Dourif was speaking in the worst American accent he ""had ever heard in his life""."	Made five trips to New Zealand while the Lord of the Rings trilogy was being filmed. He had to shave off his eyebrows each time for his role as Grima Wormtongue.	When Grima Wormtongue sees Saruman's army of 10,000, he is so shocked that a tear falls from one of his eyes.

King Theoden touching the spears of his soldiers before they charge into battle was Bernard Hill's idea.	His birthday coincides with the release date of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003).	With such a classic book, you really had to treat it as one project. And it just made complete sense to do all three at once.	What was interesting with the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) atmosphere was it was like a small budget film, almost like a small family unit. I think it was Liv (Tyler) who said “this is the most expensive low budget film I have ever been on”, and we all kind of knew what she talking about, because it did feel like a low budget film even though it had mega bucks attached to it.

He worked on his aunt and uncle's farm for many years doing odd jobs. For filming the Lord of the Rings movies, he realized that Eomer was a consummate horseman and he was nowhere near that level, so he invested a lot of time learning: six to eight weeks, five days a week, two hours a day. He wanted to learn to neck rein, a method of steering a horse using one hand while leaving the other hand free to wield a sword. He wanted to be so at one with the horse that he wasn't conscious or concerned about what the horse was doing. In addition, he also enjoys indoor rock climbing.	"He named his son ""Indiana"" after Harrison Ford's iconic character Indiana Jones, of whom Karl is a huge fan."	Is an ambassador for KidsCan, a charity that supports more than 16,000 disadvantaged children by providing shoes, food, and coats.	"[On his fondest memory of working with Peter Jackson while shooting the Lord of the Rings trilogy] Peter's really open to the humor in the day-to-day. One time, we were referencing a line in the book, ""We counted all the slain and despoiled them, then we piled the carcasses and burned them."" Of course, we went on all sorts of disgusting tangents about what else these Rohan soldiers did to the poor Orcs."	When you work so hard on making a film, it's all worthwhile when you get to experience seeing that film with an audience who thoroughly enjoy it and react to the movie.	There's only so much you can do until you get on set and see the aesthetics of what you're dealing with. Then you see what the other players are giving to you. It's all about the transfer of energy between different actors.

"Read a poem called ""The Crocodiles Are Crying"" at the Steve Irwin Memorial Service."	I think you have to find the humanity in the character and then the deterioration is a part of the process - the journey of the character. It's like playing King Lear. You can start off as a nice old man who finishes up crazy.	Listening and hearing are two different things, and acting is comprehending what the person is saying, thinking how it makes you feel and responding.

John Leigh won a legion of fans with his first television role, as nice guy cafe owner Lionel Skeggins on Shortland Street.	The only thing about TV I think, is it can be a little ageist ... I don’t think you have to be old to watch old people, or young to watch young people, if it’s an interesting story...	[On his career in acting] It was an accident is what I’m trying to say. It was a complete accident and it still is so I have no qualifications to do what I do.	[On his first scene as Hama] I’ve not done one thing and I’m sort of going “What’s the pitch of this?  Is it, like, Xena with more money?”

Yet it was not until the casting in the first movie for the elf warden Haldir that Peter Jackson made the decision to cast him in the part."	It took 3 hours to apply the blonde wig he wore in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.	In June 2007, he and 14 other actors filed a lawsuit against New Line Cinema over merchandising royalties.	Drinking coffee is kinda my major hobby... the great benefit of being an actor is you have all this spare time. My ideal is just hanging out with people - I think I am innately lazy.	The wigs were made from real human hair and so expensive. In the battle scene we all got them sweaty and dirty and covered in oil. My wig cost about $15,000 and the great worry was that I was going to ruin it.	It is as much about the enjoyment of work and the quality of life as it is about getting the next job.

Interestingly, both characters that Ure played were trying to kill a hobbit before being struck by a weapon from the back (Grishnákh survived the piercing, Gorbag didn't). 	He is known mostly for his work in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, but is also known for Spartacus (the TV series) and Hounds. 	I’m usually a villain. I’m pretty much always a bad guy. And they’re the most fun to play.	Geeks are no longer people that are just sort of funny nerds.	Star Wars is a bit too crazy.

When Martin Freeman found out, he was furious, since Bilbo spends all of his time during that scene directly in the water, and had been swallowing a great deal of it. "	Daniel Radcliffe, Shia LaBeouf, James McAvoy, Erryn Arkin, and Tobey Maguire were considered for the role of Bilbo Baggins. However, Peter Jackson has said that his first choice was always Martin Freeman. Freeman was initially unable to accept the role due to scheduling conflicts with Sherlock (2010), but Jackson re-worked the entire shooting schedule for the trilogy to accommodate him. 	Throughout the duration of filming three movies, Martin Freeman frequently joked around by giving one or two middle fingers towards cameras when behind the scenes footage was being shot.	"For a long time I was one of seven British actors who wasn't in Harry Potter. So I'd see all these films come out, and I was like, ""yeah, yeah, Harry Potter"". For a long time it was just me and six other people staring through the window like orphans in a Dickens novel. "	I never liked smoking. I like swearing. I think swearing serves a purpose. 	I think what 'The Hobbit' and Middle-earth deal in are quite universal and timeless themes of honor and love and friendship... so they're things that do resonate with people.

This has not stopped him from taking aqua aerobics classes to prepare for the role of Lee in Cold Feet, allowing himself to be water-boarded twice (In Spooks and Strike Back), swimming at least 50 laps a day to prepare for the role of Heinz Kruger in Captain America, and allowing himself to be submerged in a well for a considerable length of time while shooting an episode of Robin Hood. 	Richard Armitage hated the tan overcoat he was given to wear when the Company travelled from Lake Town to Erebor, and begged Peter Jackson to find a way to have him somehow lose it. Jackson then wrote the scene in which Smaug lets a blast of fire loose on the Company, catching the back of Thorin's coat on fire and necessitating its removal. 	While filming the Battle of Azanulbizar, Richard Armitage smacked himself in the face so hard with his shield that he managed to bite completely through his lower lip. The injury can be seen in the finished movie. When Azog holds up Thror's severed head, and Thorin screams, the left side of his lower lip is swollen, and there is a pool of blood between his gums and his lip. 	Live acting is a kind of adventure sport. I don't go abseiling or snowboarding, but I sometimes think that stepping out on stage can have the same kind of adrenaline rush. 	[on suffering an injury on the set of Spooks before his first audition for Thorin Oakenshield] I had taken so many painkillers that I hobbled into the room, sat on my hands and the whole meeting passed in a bit of a blur. If nothing else, I think, with my audition I may have succeeded in showing my ability to convey pain! 	You can spend a bit of yourself when you give yourself to a character. At the end of a job, you have to remind yourself who and what you are.

"He was nominated for a 1997 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actor in a Play of 1996 for his performance in ""ART"". "	Ken Stott's character, Balin, is the same character whose tomb is visited by the Fellowship in Moria in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) (Gimli mentioned Balin to be his cousin).	When unions were involved you had to be a member of Equity to be an actor. There was a closed shop operating. It made life very difficult, it made it very, very difficult to become an actor. But those who did did so because they persevered. It would sort out the wheat from the chaff in that those who stuck with it, those who persevered went on. And of course it also meant that the standard of work you could in many ways rely on. Not so now, now anybody can be an actor, you don't have to a member of the union, you can work wherever you like, television, film, theatre. In London, in the West End, people pay 65 pounds to a hundred pounds for a seat, they want to see professionals, they don't want to see somebody who's made a bad choice choosing somebody who can't act. And the union would help in that way.

"	He has appeared in other works with his co-stars from The Hobbit. Lee Pace in Pushing Daisies (2007), James Nesbitt in Jekyll (2007), Ken Stott in King Arthur (2004) and Martin Freeman in Ali G Indahouse (2002). 	"Dwalin uses two large battle axes in combat. Graham McTavish suggested to Peter Jackson that the axes each be named after Emily Brontë's dogs, ""Grasper"" and ""Keeper"". Jackson went for the idea, and Dwalin's axes were engraved with both names in Dwarvish runes. He also named his knuckledusters ""Insult"" and ""Injury""."	A nice part for me was that Dwalin would name his axes. It's not Tolkien, but I always remembered Emily Bronte had two hounds that she called Grasper and Keeper. She was a tiny little woman, but she had these enormous dogs and they struck me as great names. It was just for me to imagine, but I mentioned it to Peter and he said, 'Yeah, yeah, this'll be great. We can engrave them with their names and they'll look really cool!' and now there they are, Emily's axes!

Bofur's hat never leaves his head throughout the movie. 	In March 2010, the University of Ulster appointed James Nesbitt as its first ever Northern Ireland-born Chancellor. He succeeded former London Lord Mayor Sir Richard Nichols in the role. 	The thing to remember is that the work comes first, and not to get distracted by anything else. If you keep focused on the work, everything else will fall into place. That's my mantra now. 	I'm not strong-willed enough or unkind enough... or maybe simply not wise enough to tell a journalist that a subject is out of bounds. 	Like the character I played in 'Jekyll', we all have different masks we put on for different occasions. As much as we all want to lead decent lives, we're also attracted by the idea that something dark may lurk within us.

After being told he would never be able to do anything that involved public speaking his parents later demanded that it be sewn up again – as he wouldn’t shut up.	Stephen’s natural voice over style, & resonant voice have been used to promote some of Australia & New Zealand’s top companies and products. 	Stephen Hunter (Bombur) only says one line during the entire movie.	    For any role, even a Dwarf and especially a character role, the way that I approach it is to work out ways of personalising it so that on camera it looks real and not acted – trying to find the truthful performance.	Bombur’s not a small Dwarf – but I’ve never been a small man myself! – so there’s the physical challenges that come with the role. I did ask, ‘Does this mean I can start eating pies now?’ I love a good pie! 	I just love how real it is – it’s got its own history. I did history in New Zealand as a kid – the Manchurian wars, the US social welfare system – but we should have done Tolkien! It would have been just as relevant because there are some great themes to his writings, drawn from his life experiences and his thoughts on war. It’s amazing how he came up with his own world.

In addition to acting, O'Gorman is also a photographer and artist. 	O'Gorman earned a black belt in karate by the age of ten. 	To be honest, I really enjoy the chance to meet the fans because I've found with 'The Hobbit,' the fans are all really lovely and enthusiastic. 	While I'd like to make movies that are uplifting, there's always that part of you that goes, 'I want to play the evil guy because it's not me.' So anything that is not me is a challenge, and if I rise to the challenge, then I've kind of proved myself. 	Living in New Zealand, that's something that you'd like to do as an actor, but very rarely do you get an opportunity to get such a good springboard as 'The Hobbit' to help you get international work.

Aidan Turner (Kili) was cast by Peter Jackson after seeing him on Being Human (2008). Turner quit the series in order to be in The Hobbit trilogy. 	In 2014 Turner was cast as Poldark in the BBC remake. Aidan was the only actor considered for this charismatic hero. 	"I don't take myself that seriously. That's not to say I don't care about what I do, but I realize I'm in a very privileged position, and it comes with the territory. It's not bad stuff. If women want to go, ""Phwoar, look at Poldark, he's gorgeous and handsome, I'd love to take him home,"" well why should I feel offended? "	I was really into films when I was younger but I feel like a bit of a phony sometimes - I started acting because I didn't know what else to do. I filled in all these university application forms and honestly didn't want to do any of the courses. I spontaneously signed up to a part-time acting class at the same time. Then I did a full-time course, then went to drama school. When I started there I realized it's what I wanted to do. Being around committed people was very inspiring. 	In 'The Hobbit,' there were British, Irish, Australian and New Zealand actors, and Peter Jackson was adamant that we would all sound like we were from Britain somewhere.

John has also worked as a lecturer at the NZ Drama School - Toi Whakaari, Unitec's School of Performing and Screen Arts and the University of Auckland. 	Green screen is weird but as an actor one must rely on imagination and create for oneself a world in which so many other things exist. I didn't find it a problem ... in fact I challenged myself to see whether what I envisaged actually was what the director put into the scene. 	[When asked who was the biggest prankster on set] The naughtiest boy on set was probably the director, closely followed by Martin Freeman.	[When asked which LotR character he would like to be] Gandalf springs to mind. He is so key to everything that happens. I tell people it was a toss-up between Ian and me for the role - which is rubbish, but that's what I tell 'em. OR ... Galadriel's secret love interest. Why? Do you need to ask?

The same axe is wielded by both Dwarves.	In 1995 he won an NZ Film and Television award for his work in WWII era movie The Last Tattoo. 	He played Charles Darwin in the 2009 play Collapsing Creation.	When you are an actor, you dream of being part of some big epic movie, but when my agent rang to tell me I got offered the role of Gloin, I didn't believe it. 	It's phenomenal. We have all got our own following. There are people who truly are obsessed with your character. Most of them are really charming and some of them are slightly too obsessed.

In June 2007, he and 14 other actors filed a lawsuit against New Line Cinema over merchandising royalties 	In 2011 he had the moving experience of acting in based on a true story tele-movie Tangiwai - A Love Story. His grandfather was one of the coroners at Tangiwai, after the train plunged into the Whangaehu River in December 1953. 	I’ve always believed that the key to enjoying a career in the film industry is to be punctual, respectful and diligent — and remember that you are part of the whole, not just the star attraction. 	[On being knocked out during performances of the highly-physical Skin Tight] I just carried on — the other actor didn’t even realise that I had been knocked out.	[On being asked his favorite memory from filming ‘The Hobbit’] The barrel scene was the one we really enjoyed doing. But I think, for all of us, the thing that we’ll take away is that first day on Bag End. There’s Ian McKellen as Gandalf – and he WAS Gandalf – and Martin Freeman WAS Bilbo, and we WERE our characters, for the first time we weren’t actors any more, we were characters in a film. And that was a pretty special moment.

It consists of classic children's stories narrated and performed with a Kiwi twist. "	Hadlow works in Christchurch's Court Theatre, where he has directed, produced, and acted in many plays. Hadlow is known for interacting with the audience whenever possible. 	In addition to his acting career, Hadlow is a commissioned lieutenant commander in the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve. 	Having a neutral accent means you can click into things quicker, and not have your roles determined by your vowels.	It's dwindled somewhat, because of money, because of changes in social attitudes, because of education. I don't think we have as much theatre in schools as we used to. If children aren't exposed to live theatre at a young age, it's not something that becomes part of their psyche. 	It's just lovely to know what you do maybe enables people to enjoy their lives a little bit more. It makes them laugh, and cry, and enjoy theatre. And if I'm doing that, then I feel great. That I can use my talent to help people to enjoy their lives.

The fish that were dumped into the barrels to hide Bilbo and the Dwarves were real fish, with a few rubber props mixed in. At one point, Adam Brown (Ori) had as much as four hundred pounds of fish dumped directly on him. Brown hates fish, and had to fight his own phobia while buried in them in the barrel, and while he waited for crew members to pull them off of him. Since the fish were slippery, they had to be taken out by hand one at a time. 	Co-founder of the comedy writing/performing team - 'Plested and Brown'. 	As a first movie, 'The Hobbit' is not a bad place to start. 	You kind of forget he's Peter Jackson in a way because he's so normal; he's lovely. It's like having a friend direct you, except it's Peter Jackson. 	It was just really odd to be in a room with Ian McKellen sharing cucumber sandwiches.

While his friendship with animals is consistent with the book, this may also be a nod to Kent-Smith's early stage act, Sylveste McCoy (from which he took his professional name), in which he stuffed ferrets down his trousers.	He is the only actor to appear in both Doctor Who (1963) and Doctor Who (1996). 	He is adept at playing both the xylophone and the spoons. He can also juggle.	I don't relax. I sit down and contemplate all the energetic things I should do. 	Theatre is the principal job of an actor. An actor's job is to tell a story to someone in a room. TV and film can be great and I really love doing it, but it is a different way of telling a story. Film is like painting with a tiny Japanese paintbrush, second by second. But the reward is painting with a broad brush with a live audience; you get the response, then it affects your next mood - you can sense the mood and their laughter. It's alive. TV is not dead but you are part of a jigsaw. On stage you look much larger than you are. You can have subtle changes of timing; how you place a punchline in a joke or movement or emotion according to an audience. 	[on Doctor Who (1963)] I'm very proud to be part of it. I'm a national institution. I'm in a museum. I thought you had to be dead to be in a museum, but I'm in a museum somewhere.

The fact that I hated it somehow pleased them even more. 	It was thrilling to work on this film and when you see my extraordinary interpretation you realise why I immediately fell into the arms of Jenny Craig, and minor cosmetic surgery. I always thought motion capture was something you did when you were taking a specimen at the doctor. 	Disguising myself as different characters and I had a whole box of dressing up clothes ... Red Indian, sailor suit, Chinese costume and I was very spoiled in that way ... I also found that entertaining people gave me a great feeling of release, making people laugh was a very good way of befriending them. People couldn't hit you if they were laughing.

His entry Men of Steel involved a young man returning to his hometown from New Zealand, to find despair with the closing of the steelworks. 	He attended Liverpool University where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in Celtic Studies and English Literature. 	For years I thought acting was an inferior profession — the noble calling was obviously writing. But I’ve got to love acting — it’s a really interesting discipline. The combination is perfect. You act with other people and then go off and write on your own. 	Because I wrote and acted, I somehow managed to make a living. Surviving is a success in this business. 	I just carry on as I am until I drop. The idea of retiring is not something I take seriously. I just keep on going. Work gets less and less. Many parts are for younger people, in their 30s, but there are still parts for old guys, and I enjoy acting.

Upon wrapping The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014), he kept his prosthetic elf ears and his character's elven-sword. The ears are kept in a book, while he keeps the sword in his umbrella stand. 	"When his parents visited him on the set of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014) they were hired by director Peter Jackson to play extras. However, they are not to be seen in the final film, and according to Pace, then it's because his father was ""hamming it up"" in his brief screen-time. "	Peter Jackson has the sort of imagination that no one else has. 	All I ever remember wanting to do, as a kid, was act - nothing else. In fact, about the only thing, other than acting, that I'd like to do is go live in the woods, build a log cabin at the top of a hill and try and hide away from the modern world. So, in many ways, [The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013)] ticked all the boxes: not only is it the ultimate acting challenge but it's also biggest adventure you could go on while making a film. 	[On the difference between TV and film acting] The day is different. The way the day runs is totally different. With TV, you have so much to get done during the day that you don't really have a lot of time to feel your way through it. I know before I walk on the set exactly what I'm going to do. With film you can kind of find your way in it a little more, play with it some.

I was given this name after my uncle who was the Bishop Of New Zealand.

Success is the freedom to do what you want, with whom you want, when you want, wherever you want. 	Writing keeps my mind occupied during the down time in my acting career. Even when I am working there are times when I have multiple days off each week. Also the writing allows me to ‘do’ movies that I would never do as an actor. 	So being a bad guy or a good guy, well to me at least, does not really seem to matter. After all bad guys are just good guys with differing beliefs and moral codes.

Azog was going to be played by Conan Stevens, but he was replaced by John Rawls (who got to film the flashback of the Battle of Azanulbizar), who was then replaced finally by Manu Benett. Similarly, the character was originally portrayed through prosthetics/makeup, but Peter Jackson wanted Azog to have a unique design from the other Orcs, so the CG/mo-cap version was put in place of the original Azog. Rawls would end up receiving the role of Azog's Mook Lieutenant, Yazneg, who got Azog's original design.	He studied at the EADA Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

When this came to the attention of director Peter Jackson, he arranged to have McKenzie reprise the (still-officially-unnamed) character in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003).

Son of actor Peter McKenzie, who plays Elendil in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). 	One half of New Zealand 'folk comedy' duo Flight of the Conchords, with Jemaine Clement.	My character is called Lindir, I hang out with Elrond… I’ve got a few lines in Elvish. 	That's the great thing about Henson's work. He didn't ever play down to children.

Fluent in French and loves reading, writing, painting, long walks, tea and nature. 	Even if you're unhappy, just pretend that you're happy. Eventually, your smile will be contagious to yourself. I had to learn that, I used to think, 'I'm being fake,' but you know what? Better to be fake and happy than real and miserable. 	To his defence, Tolkien was writing in 1937. The world is a different place today. I kept repeatedly telling people that in this day and age, to put nine hours of cinema entertainment in theatres for young girls to go and watch, and not have one female character - it's subliminally telling them that 'You don't matter, you're not important and you're not pivotal to the story'. I think that they were very brave and very right in saying 'We won't do that to the young female audience that will come and watch our films'. And even for women my own age, I think it's time that we stop making stories that are only about men. I love that they make Tauriel a hero. 	If I didn't try to help others, I'd be no better than the Paris Hiltons of the world, waltzing around with their Louis Vuitton bags and their little dogs.

"Has central heterochromia as well as sectoral heterochromia, the ""groovy"" but harmless genetic mutation that his friend James McAvoy describes in X-Men: First Class (2011). Central heterochromia is where each eye has multiple colors - in his case, each has a different but nearly identical combination of blue, green, and gold. Sectoral heterochromia is where one eye has a spot (or sector) of different coloration; his right eye has a brown ""freckle"" of color that, while small, is typical of sectoral heterochromia. "	"His female fans were originally known as ""Cumberbitches"", but are now known as the ""CumberCollective"" or ""Cumberpeople"". Cumberbatch is uncomfortable with the term ""Cumberbitches"" because he says its non-inclusive and pejorative "	[on his look] It's the blessing of having a weird face - somewhere between an otter and something people find vaguely attractive.

Homophobia is still a world problem. Homosexuality isn't and never has been. Homosexuals are not interested in making other people homosexual. Homophobics are interested in making other people homophobic. 	I sometimes wonder if you Americans aren't often fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there. 	To be human and to be adult means constantly to be in the grip of opposing emotions, to have daily to reconcile apparently conflicting tensions. I want this, but need that. I cherish this, but I adore its opposite too. I'm maddened by this institution yet I prize it above all others.

It was a dream come true to get on set and to work with Peter Jackson. It was a thrill from start to finish. He is a lovely, lovely man and it was an absolute thrill to be asked to do it.	On a very basic level, I learned the basic movie craft on that film.

Learned how to catwalk and do interviews. I walked on that stage like I owned it. 	I don't like bossy people. Men or women. But a bossy man is much easier to deal with than a bossy woman.
