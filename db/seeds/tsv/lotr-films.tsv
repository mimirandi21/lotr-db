https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Standard	The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer, to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. 	178m	"For high-tech tasks, a computer program called MASSIVE made armies of CGI orcs, elves, and humans. These digital creations could ""think"" and battle independently, identifying friend or foe, thanks to individual fields of vision. Director Peter Jackson's team could click on one creature, in a crowd scene of twenty thousand, and see through his ""eyes"". Different species even boast unique fighting styles. "	During the Council of Elrond, leaves are continually falling in the background to suggest that this is a meeting that is taking place outside. This meant about half a dozen crew members were positioned above the set, dropping leaves at various intervals. This also meant that the production department had to collect numerous sacks of leaves during autumn, and of course dead leaves turn brown fairly quickly, which also meant that every one of those leaves had to be painted.	When Pippin is being hit with the apples after asking about second breakfast, it is Viggo Mortensen chucking the apple at his head. They had to shoot the scene sixteen times to get it just right, and Billy Boyd says he believes Mortensen enjoyed himself immensely. 	8.8	92	91.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/mediaviewer/rm3592958976?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_CR0,60,640,360_AL_UX477_CR0,0,477,268_AL_.jpg	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2001	PG-13

A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer, to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. 	208m	"After the New Zealand premiere, director Peter Jackson joined the actors who played the nine members of the Fellowship by getting a commemorative tattoo of his own. While their tattoos were the Elvish symbol for ""9"", Jackson received an Elvish ""10"". "	In this movie's first theatrical release, a story circulated that when Sam tells Frodo that he is now the farthest he has ever been from home, a car is visible driving by in the background (top-right corner of the screen). Arguments ensued. Some said it was smoke from a chimney, others said they saw the glint of sunlight reflected from the windshield of a fast-moving vehicle. In the version of the movie released on DVD, there is definitely no car, only chimney smoke and a one-frame flash of light that could conceivably be a car, but not in any sense that could be considered a goof. Peter Jackson said (in the commentary track on the Extended DVD) that he looked at every frame on a computer, and has never seen anything resembling a car, and claims that it's nonsense (and certainly the original sighting remains unconfirmed by IMDb goof spotters). In the documentary of the Extended DVD version, editor John Gilbert says that there was a car in the background, but they thought no one would notice it. They got rid of it in the DVD version. In a subsequent magazine interview, Jackson agreed that the car was there. 	"Gollum looks different in this movie than in later installments, because scheduling forced those scenes to be filmed based on an early design (made before Andy Serkis was cast in the role). He is only seen in brief glimpses, partly due to this discrepancy, and partly to tease audiences before his entrance in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002). Peter Jackson (jokingly) said in the commentary on the Extended DVD that sometime in the future he would enjoy creating a ""Special Edition"" (à la Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)) where this inconsistency could be fixed.

A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer, to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. 	228m	When Gandalf had his big stand-off scene with the Balrog, Sir Ian McKellen was actually acting to a green ping pong ball, which was used, along with the greenscreen technology employed during filming, to give him and other cast members a reference point for some of the larger CGI characters. 	Originally, the narration at the prologue was to be spoken by Elijah Wood, but it was felt that the information imparted had little bearing on the character of Frodo. Sir Ian McKellen also recorded a narration, but once again, it was felt that Gandalf wasn't the right character to speak it; neither he nor Frodo was present at the events described in the prologue. They eventually settled on Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, as it emphasizes the timelessness of the elves. 	It is estimated that filming of the trilogy pumped about $200 million into the New Zealand economy. The New Zealand government even created a Minister for Lord of the Rings, whose remit was to exploit all the economic opportunities the movies represented. 	8.8	92	91.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/mediaviewer/rm1566200320?ref_=ttmi_mi_all_prd_692	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_CR0,60,640,360_AL_UX477_CR0,0,477,268_AL_.jpg	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2001	PG-13

A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer, to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. 	171m	The Elvish language lines spoken in this movie are not just quotes from the book, they were derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's own limited dictionary of that language. Dialect coach Andrew Jack used recordings of Tolkien reading his books to guide the actors' and actresses' pronunciations. 	Hobbiton was made a year before production began to make it look like it was a natural, lived-in place, complete with real vegetable patches. The greens department regulated the length of the grass by having sheep eat it. 	Although in the movie it seems to be only a few weeks or so, in the book, the time between when Gandalf leaves to research the Ring, tries to find Gollum, and when he returns to send Frodo on his adventure is a span of seventeen years. This was significantly shortened in the film for continuity reasons. 	8.8	92	91.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/mediaviewer/rm3592958976?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_CR0,60,640,360_AL_UX477_CR0,0,477,268_AL_.jpg	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2001	PG-13
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261	The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers	Standard	The Fellowship is torn apart. Sauron's power is growing stronger. While venturing on to Mordor, Frodo and Sam come across the grotesque creature Gollum, who is forever consumed by the Ring's power. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli meet up with new allies in the Plains of Rohan. Together, they must work to defend the people of Rohan against Sauron's puppet Saruman as he unleashes his armies from Isengard. All the while, Sauron prepares to launch an attack on Gondor. The War for the Ring begins here. 	179m	"In the wide shots of Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli running after the Orcs, all three performers are running injured. Orlando Bloom had a couple of broken ribs (from a fall off of a horse). Viggo Mortensen had a broken toe (from kicking the helmet in the Orcs funeral pyre scene). Brett Beattie (Gimli's stunt double) had a knee injury. Peter Jackson said that all three were very dedicated and continued to film the scene, often yelling ""ouch"" or ""ow"" after ""cut"" was called. "	On the wall of Helm's Deep during the battle, a one-eyed warrior turns to the camera, revealing his scarred empty socket. The performer who played him showed up as an extra, wearing an eye patch. Director Peter Jackson politely asked to see what was under the patch, and then inquired if the gentleman would be interested in appearing in the movie sans eye patch. The gentleman was reluctant at first, and quite self-conscious, but afterward, said the experience had made him more comfortable with his condition. 	Sean Astin shot his short movie The Long and Short of It (2003) during a re-shoot in New Zealand. Lucasfilm was demonstrating its new high definition digital video cameras (used on Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)) for Peter Jackson, and Astin asked the Lucasfilm crew if they could stay an extra day, so he could use the camera to shoot his short movie. They agreed, and Astin shot the movie in six hours.	8.7	87	95.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/mediaviewer/rm306845440?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2073101337?playlistId=tt0167261&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2002	PG-13

To achieve this, the Orc actors had to swill a liquorice-based mouthwash prior to each of their scenes. 	The main door of Helm's Deep was built so heavy, and so well, that the real battering ram that was built to knock down the gates failed to do so until the door was weakened. Someone had built the door a little bit too well, and director Peter Jackson can be heard on the Extended Edition DVD commenting that if they had to defend a castle, he would want the WETA workshop guys to build the door. 	"The ten thousand Uruk-Hai battle chants for the Helm's Deep battle sequence were provided by a stadium of twenty-five thousand cricket fans, who chanted the war chants, ""Derbgoo, nashgshoo, derbgoo, dashshoo"", spelled out on the Diamond Vision screen, with Peter Jackson leading the crowd.

There were so many of these shirts that extras would often meet other extras in New Zealand's main cities, because they would recognize the shirts. "	The location for Edoras was in the midst of a national park. The Conservation Society of New Zealand gave them permission to film there on the proviso that they left it in exactly the same condition that they found it. This meant lifting most of the natural vegetation and grasses up, and storing them in a purpose-built nursery, as filming in the location would last approximately sixteen months. 	The first appearance of the White Wizard in Fangorn Forest was made intentionally confusing, by compositing the eyes of Sir Christopher Lee into the face of Sir Ian McKellen. The voices of both were also mixed in alternating intensity to add to the confusion. 	8.7	87	95.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/mediaviewer/rm306845440?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2073101337?playlistId=tt0167261&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2002	PG-13

Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the One Ring, while Aragorn leads the forces of good against Sauron's evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith. 	201m	To get enough extras for the Battle at the Black Gate, a few hundred members of the New Zealand Army were brought in. They apparently were so enthusiastic during the battle scenes that they kept breaking the wooden swords and spears they were given. 	The dead oliphaunt carcass used in this movie is reportedly the largest prop ever built for a movie. According to members of the prop department, director Peter Jackson still thought it could have been bigger. 	The last shot of principal photography was when the newly-crowned Aragorn bows to the four Hobbits. Although Viggo Mortensen did not need to be on-set for that day, he nevertheless insisted on attending. He didn't have a crown (it wasn't necessary, he wasn't being filmed), so he fashioned one out of paper. With each successive take, the crown was becoming more ornate and sillier as crew members kept decorating it, so the four actors playing the Hobbits often had difficulty suppressing their giggles. 	8.9	94	93.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/mediaviewer/rm584928512?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2073101337?playlistId=tt0167260&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2003	PG-13

In an interview done after the release of the Extended Edition DVD, he acknowledged that the makers gave him several arguments for trimming the scene (pacing and time constraints), but in his opinion, none of them justified omitting such an important narrative element. As a result, Lee and Peter Jackson had a brief falling out. Lee eventually agreed to appear in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), and asked Jackson if his scenes had been cut when he was invited to the premiere. "	Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd were standing off-camera during Sam's wedding scene, pretending to be wedding guests, in order to help Sean Astin's performance. After Sarah McLeod threw her bridal bouquet to Boyd, Mortensen gave Boyd a passionate kiss. The filming of the scene (and the kiss) appear on the Extended Edition DVD extras. 	"EASTER EGGS: On the Extended Edition DVD, disc one, as per the first two movies, go to the scene selection menu, to the last page. Press down until a ring icon appears next to the ""new scene"" phrase; up comes a satellite ""interview"" of Elijah Wood, given by Dominic Monaghan using a German accent.

He thought it was funny to be doing filming on a movie that had already won the Best Picture Oscar. 	"(Extended Edition only) The runes on the helmet worn by the Mouth of Sauron, when transliterated, say ""Lammen Gorthaur"". Lammen means voice, and Gorthaur, which is mentioned in the Silmarillion, means Dread Abomination, another title by which Sauron was known. The complete phrase, ""Voice of the Dread Abomination"", identifies the speaker as the Mouth of Sauron. "	When Frodo is stabbed by Shelob's stinger, Elijah Wood was actually stabbed with a prop one. In the Extended Edition DVD commentary, he and Sean Astin comment that it was not only very painful, but had actually done damage, to the point that Wood had to stay in the hospital for a couple of days. Astin (on the commentary track) jokes that they used appendicitis as the excuse, but wonder if that event is what (ironically) caused Wood's actual episode of appendicitis later on, in 2003. 	8.9	94	93.00%	https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F51KDf5e3QkL.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLord-Rings-Towers-Extended-Blu-ray%2Fdp%2FB008GFI4V8&tbnid=1RLbwy0Hz7ntbM&vet=12ahUKEwiCq-n3gOXtAhXBY60KHdWZAt0QMygbegUIARCWAg..i&docid=qMf_j-QzD-m9kM&w=395&h=500&q=lord%20of%20the%20rings%20return%20blu%20ray%20extended%20picture&ved=2ahUKEwiCq-n3gOXtAhXBY60KHdWZAt0QMygbegUIARCWAg	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2073101337?playlistId=tt0167260&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2003	PG-13

Remembering that Denethor asks Pippin to sing him a song when Faramir heads off to war, she resurrected the lyrics from the novel (where it is actually sung by all four hobbits), and Boyd came up with the tune for it. 	So unpleasant was Peter Jackson's experience in dealing with Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein, when the film was being developed at Miramax, that their shared credit at the end of this film appears over a pencil sketch of a man fighting off two oversized trolls. 	After Aragorn is crowned as the King of Gondor, he moves through the crowd, reunites with Arwen and finally arrives at where the four hobbits are standing. They begin to bow to him, but Aragorn looks at them and says: Aragorn: My friends...you bow to no one. And then he kneels to them. The camera pans out and shows the entire audience moving to bow to them (as the king does). Peter Jackson has said that this is his favourite scene out of the entire trilogy.	8.9	94	93.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/mediaviewer/rm584928512?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2073101337?playlistId=tt0167260&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	2003	PG-13

Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ""precious"" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know. "	169m	"Asked how many wizards there are, Gandalf says there are five, naming Saruman, Radagast, and himself, then saying he can't remember the names of the other two, merely saying, ""The two blues"". Their names, Alatar and Pallando, appear in the book Unfinished Tales, a collection of J.R.R. Tolkien ideas and half-manuscripts edited into book form by his son Christopher Tolkien. The filmmakers didn't have rights to use material from that book, so the two blue wizards remain unnamed in this movie. "	Azog was a last minute digital addition to this movie. He was originally an actor in prosthetics, but Peter Jackson found the effect lacking presence, and had Weta create a digital character, motion-captured by Manu Bennett, and inserted the character over the previously-filmed live Azog footage. The original Azog appears in the movie as Yazneg, the ill-fated Orc Lieutenant. 	The opening scenes, in which Sir Ian Holm plays the older Bilbo, do not appear in the book, which is told in present-time and not as a flashback. These scenes take place on the same day as Bilbo's birthday seen in the beginning of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). Shortly after the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Holm recorded similar scenes, this time as Frodo, for inclusion in a new boxed set version of the BBC Radio version of The Lord of the Rings. 	7.8	58	64.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/mediaviewer/rm3577719808?ref_=tt_ov_i	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi650683417?playlistId=tt0903624&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Adventure, Fantasy	2012	PG-13

Smaug only appeared as an eye in this movie, and as a vague outline in the distance, because Peter Jackson had not yet decided on the look of his body. A similar thing had happened with Gollum in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), whose brief appearances were largely obscured because the character had been redesigned for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). 	When Gandalf is explaining to Bilbo about true courage being knowing when to spare a life, the music is a rendition of the music played in Moria when Gandalf and Frodo are discussing the incident where Bilbo spares Gollum's life, which is where Bilbo applied Gandalf's advice, and it appears again for that moment in An Unexpected Journey. From The Fellowship Of The Ring: Frodo: It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Bilbo's sparing of Gollum's life is of course Calling Forward to when Frodo does the same at Emyn Muil. This is a critical part of the story as it sets in motion a chain of events that allows for the destruction of the One Ring. 	7.8	58	64.00%	https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2FA1DA2qbnlcL._SY606_.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHobbit-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Extended%2Fdp%2FB014GJBP54&tbnid=KRstaaHoQnDm6M&vet=12ahUKEwjJmLLxgeXtAhUND60KHWbtBNgQMygBegUIARCxAQ..i&docid=dCVkvh1QV41bRM&w=455&h=606&q=the%20hobbit%20extended%20picture&ved=2ahUKEwjJmLLxgeXtAhUND60KHWbtBNgQMygBegUIARCxAQ	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi650683417?playlistId=tt0903624&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Adventure, Fantasy	2012	PG-13
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1170358	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug	Standard	The thirteen dwarves commanded by Thorin, the burglar Bilbo Baggins and the wizard Gandalf travel to Lonely Mountain to steal the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug to join the dwarves. During their dangerous journey, they need to fight against giant spiders and Orcs and they are captured but flee from the Elves. But Smaug is not easily deceived and flies to Lake-town to destroy the town and the dwellers. 	161m	Bilbo steals the keys to the prison from an Elf addressed as Elros. Elros is also the name of Elrond's brother. The two brothers had human and Elvish ancestry on their mother's and father's side, and as such were perfectly half-Elf and half-Man. While Elrond chose to be an immortal Elf, Elros chose to become a mortal man. He thus became the progenitor of the Numenorian race, and an ancestor of Aragorn. 	It took one processor-week to render a scale from Smaug's body. In other words, if a single computer processor were used, each scale would have taken a week to render. Fortunately, Weta Digital used a large server farm of multi-processor machines for its effects rendering. 	"After the barrel riding sequence, as the Orcs continue to search for the Dwarves, one of them dips his finger into a pool of blood on the ground and tastes it, spitting in disgust and says ""Dwarf blood!"" This mimics a scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) where Gimli dips his finger in a similar fashion into some blood left on some leaves and tastes it, only to spit out in disgust and say ""Orc blood!""

In the extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), his son Gimli notes that Dwarf women are often mistaken for men, on account of their beards. 	"Smaug is one of the regular rankers in the ""Richest fictional characters"" by Forbes. According to Michael Noer, writer for Forbes magazine, Smaug is the wealthiest fictional character, with a treasure having a calculated value of over $62 billion. "	"The rune inscription inside the hidden door, read by Gloin, says: ""Herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk. May the Heart of the Mountain unite all Dwarves in defense of this home.""

However, as Prince Thorin II Oakenshield rapidly succumbs to the hypnotic allure of the corrupting mounds of gold, friendships shatter over greed, and a war is brewing. And just as all races prepare for battle, dark lord Sauron's evil forces led by the Orc chieftain, Azog, emerge from the dark bowels of the earth, flanking the vast battlefield, in Middle-earth's greatest conflict that will decide everyone's future. 	144m	When the movie was promoted with a panel at San Diego Comic Con, several fans camped outside the hall the day before the panel in order to get seats. In the middle of the night, the fans were woken up by cast members Lee Pace and Andy Serkis, who greeted the waiting fans and delivered autographs and photos for hours. In the end, Pace passed out from exhaustion, and shared a mattress with a fan. 	Only movie in the franchise to acknowledge Legolas' quiver running out of arrows. Legolas' empty quiver can be seen at the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002). 	"The song in the end credits is ""The Last Goodbye"", composed and performed by Billy Boyd, who played Pippin in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Boyd wrote and composed the song for the movie.

"In the theatrical version, Bombur does not get to say a single word, but he does get to blow a horn. [He does, however, have one line in the Extended Edition (hands Bifur the axe that had been dislodged from his head) ""Here you go cousin.""] "	For the scenes where Galadriel picks up Gandalf, a dummy of Sir Ian McKellen was used. This dummy was called Michael Gambon (it was even included with that name on call sheets (as seen in the appendices documentary)) because Gambon and McKellen sometimes get mistaken for one another. 	7.4	59	59.00%	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2310332/mediaviewer/rm1448759808?ref_=ttmi_mi_all_prd_523	https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1092005657?playlistId=tt2310332&ref_=tt_ov_vi	Adventure, Fantasy	2014	R
